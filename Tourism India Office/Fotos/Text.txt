Indus Valley Civilization - 3300 BCE:
The Indus Valley Civilization, also known as the Harappan Civilization, flourished around 3300 BCE along the banks of the Indus River. It was a remarkable urban civilization renowned for its sophisticated city planning, advanced drainage systems, and intricate craftsmanship. With major settlements like Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa, this civilization showcased remarkable trade, artistry in pottery, and an early form of writing. Its decline around 1300 BCE remains a mystery, but its legacy endures as one of the world's oldest known civilizations, providing valuable insights into early urban life.

Buddha's Enlightenment - 528 BCE:

Buddha's teachings on overcoming suffering and achieving enlightenment spread across India and eventually globally, influencing countless followers and shaping diverse cultures. His enlightenment fundamentally transformed spiritual practices, emphasizing compassion, mindfulness, and the pursuit of inner peace.
